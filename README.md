**📘 NLP Buddy**

NLP Buddy is an AI-powered assistant designed to help users interact with Natural Language Processing (NLP) content efficiently.
It combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), OCR pipelines, and a chatbot with conversational memory to deliver context-aware, grounded, and persistent responses.

**🚀 Features**

**1) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Retrieves relevant chunks from NLP documents using FAISS as the vector store.

**2) PDF & OCR Support**:

  pdfplumber for extracting structured text from PDFs.

  OCR pipeline to handle scanned/image-based documents.
  

**3) Conversational Memory Buffer**: Keeps track of past conversations for context-aware responses.
**4) LLM-Powered Chatbot**: Uses Gemini LLM for generating natural responses.
**5) Embeddings from Hugging Face**: Provides semantic search and document retrieval.



**🛠️ Tech Stack**

**LLM:** Google Gemini
**Embeddings:** Hugging Face models
**Vector Database:** FAISS
**Document Processing:** pdfplumber, pytesseract (OCR)
**Frameworks:** LangChain, Python

**⚙️ Workflow**

Document Ingestion: PDFs are processed using pdfplumber, OCR extracts text from scanned docs.

Embedding & Indexing: Hugging Face embeddings are stored in FAISS for similarity search.

User Query: The chatbot receives a query.

RAG Process: FAISS retrieves relevant document chunks.

Response Generation: The Gemini LLM generates an answer grounded in retrieved context.

Memory Handling: A memory buffer stores conversation history for continuity.
